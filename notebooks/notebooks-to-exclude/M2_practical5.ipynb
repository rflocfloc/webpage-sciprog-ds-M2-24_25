    "## Sorting algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of sorting algorithms is quite simple:  \n",
    ">given an input sequence ($U$) of (at least partially) un-sorted elements $U=u_{1},u_{2}, ..., u_{n}$, output a new sequence $S = s_{1}, s_{2}, ... , s_{n}$ which is a permutation of the elements in $U$ such that $s_{1}\\leq s_{2}, ..., \\leq s_{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several sorting algorithms exist, the first one we will work with is **selection sort**.\n",

   "source": [
    "## Selection sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection sort is the simplest of the sorting algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of **selection sort** is that given $U=u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{n}$ the algorithm loops through all the elements of $U$, finds the minimum $u_m$ and places it at the beginning of the sequence $U$, swapping $u_{1}$ with $u_m$. At the next iteration, the algorithm continues looking for the minimum starting from $u_2$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $U$ has $n$ elements, we need to perform the following two steps for each position $i=0,..,n-1$ in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (argmin) Find index of the minimum element in the sublist $U[i:]$, let's call it $min$ (i.e. $u_{min} = min(U[i:])$);\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (swap) Swap $u_{min}$ with $u_i$;\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder on how selection sort works is shown in this picture taken from the lecture slides. Yellow cells are the minimum found at each iteration, while orange cells are those already sorted by previous iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/selection_sort.png)\n",
    "\n",

At that point the two lists are merged into a bigger **sorted** list by using a **merge** method.  \n",

This method builds the return list by getting the minimum element of the two lists, \"removing\" it from the corresponding list and appending it to the list with the result. \"removal\" can be done by using two indexes pointing to the smallest elements of each of the two (sub)lists and incrementing the index of the minimum of the two (i.e. the element that is also copied to the result list);\n",

    "2. (```recursiveMergeSort```): gets an unordered (sub)list, the index of the beginning of the list, and the index of the end of the list.

(*divide*) partition the initial list $U = u_1, .., u_n$ in two non-empty sublists (reordering the elements) such that all the elements in the first sublist are lower than the elements in the second. The pivot element $u_j$ is such that all the elements $u_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\lt j$ are lower than $u_j$ and all $u_k$ for $k > j$ are higher than $u_j$;\n",

The pivot is initially set to the first element of the sublist, then all the elements in the interval ```start``` - ```end``` are compared to it (using an index $i$) and placed right after the pivot if smaller (updating an index $j$ on where the pivot should go at the end of the procedure), left untouched otherwise. At the end the pivot is moved to position $j$. The pivot is yellow and moved elements are pink:\n",
